# Predicting Plant Gene Expression Levels with LLM's

### Leverage BERT for Gene Expression Prediction: 
Utilize BERT's powerful language representation capabilities to model the complex relationships within gene expression data and predict expression levels accurately.

## Frontend and Authentication

### React Frontend: 
Utilize React.js to build an interactive and user-friendly frontend interface for accessing and visualizing gene expression predictions. Leverage React's component-based architecture for modular development and easy maintenance.

### Firebase Authentication: Implement Firebase Authentication to secure the application and manage user authentication. Firebase provides robust authentication services, including email/password authentication, social login providers, and custom authentication mechanisms.
